        <li>Dear <input type="text" name="CL_NAME" class="inputTxt" />,</li>
        <li>Mental health treatment is a partnership between the psychiatrist, therapist and patient.  As such, it is important for your mental health condition to be regularly evaluated and treated at scheduled appointments.  As a minimum requirement, you must see a therapist at least every six months and more often than this if recommended.</li>
        <li>During a recent review of your mental health record, it was discovered:
            <ul><li><input type="text" name="CL_DISCOVERED" class="inputTxt-max" /></li></ul>
        </li>

        <li>At this point, it appears that you no longer wish to have your mental health condition treated by RiverValley Behavioral Health.  If this is the case, you need take no further action; we will automatically inactivate your mental health medical record and will terminate your care in thirty (30) days.  If you allow this to occur, no additional prescriptions or therapy visits will be authorized.  Please note we advise against having you abruptly stop therapy or abruptly stop taking medications, as either action may be harmful to your mental and/or physical health.  Also, medications which have refills on them beyond thirty days should not be filled or taken unless you are under the active care of a physician.</li>
        
        <li>If you have decided to transfer your treatment to a therapist or physician from another agency, please feel free to contact the therapist or physician of your choice.  Upon your request, we can suggest appropriate professionals who may be willing to accept you as a patient.  If you do decide to obtain treatment elsewhere, we will forward your clinical records to your new provider on your written authorization.</li>
        
        <li>If you decide to arrange treatment elsewhere, please do so prior to the expiration of thirty (30) days so there is no interruption in your treatment.  However, if you decide to continue your care with RiverValley Behavioral Health, please contact us at 689-6510 or 1-800-737-0696 within the next thirty days.</li>
		
        <li>In any event, RiverValley Behavioral Health physician and/or therapist will be available to treat you until <input type="text" name="CL_WORD" class="inputTxt-max" />.  Also, our Crisis Line is available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.  The Crisis Line numbers are 270-684-9466 or 1-800-433-7191.</li>
   
        <li>Sincerely,</li>
